\section{Overview}
Machines are designed by humans, for humans, 
to make everyday life easier. Until a machine has a 
method to control it, either through human control or 
autonomous control, they are nothing more than a paperweight. 
In our everyday world, cars are a ubiquitous machine used to 
transport people and goods to their destination, and thereby 
are a key pillar of a productive economy and society. In the 
21st century, vehicles are becoming more interconnected and 
sophisticated than ever and use computers to control almost 
every subsystem of the vehicle. Control systems encapsulate 
the “brains” behind such machines, allowing them to interpret 
their environment using sensors, determine a desired state, and 
manipulate the environment using actuators to achieve the 
desired state. They convert a physical stimulus (from the 
environment, including a user) into a control signal for a 
component. Some examples of control systems seen in modern 
cars today are engine/transmission controls, HVAC controls, 
battery management (in hybrid/electric vehicles, anti-lock 
braking (ABS) and electronic stability program (ESP).
