\maketitle

Our team: Controls Freaks, has had a long love for 
the world of control systems. Our mission is to develop 
a control system for McMaster’s Formula FSAE team, to learn 
and better understand how vehicle’s and similar systems operate, 
and to cohesively work in a team to bring together the knowledge 
we have gained over our university careers into one final project. 
Our team is primarily mechatronics based, with four members 
(Laura, Jason, Abhishek, and Derek) being in the program, while 
our final member, Dharak, brings expertise from the computer engineering 
program and an understanding of the McMaster team's vehicle sub-systems.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Team meetings will be held once a week on 
Thursdays at 8:00 pm and will go for roughly 
one hour. Ad hoc meetings will be held as needed.

	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classificaiton, etc.?
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Libraries you will likely be using?
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}
