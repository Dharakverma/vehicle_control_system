# Vehicle Control System Capstone Project

***Mission Statement:*** We are aiming to design, simulate, implement, and test a fully functioning vehicle control system for a quarter-scale Formula 1 style electric vehicle. The control system will be responsible for managing the following vehicle subsystems; battery management, cooling, vehicle mode selection, tractive motor, and vehicle dynamics. This capstone will be in collaboration with the MAC Formula Electric FSAE team, where we will be responsible for providing them with a suitable control system for their vehicle within competition rule specifications. We will be working with the embedded hardware provided by MAC Formula Electric for implementing and testing our control system once software-based simulation and validation is complete. Integration of the control system within MAC Formula Electric's current embedded system will be handled by members of their Embedded Systems team.
